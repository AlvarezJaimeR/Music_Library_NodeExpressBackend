# Music_Library_NodeExpressBackend

## Music Library Application back-end - created a Node.js and Express.js backend server and utilizing MongoDB

This is the back-end of our front-end React app at https://github.com/AlvarezJaimeR/Music_Library
<br>
Please see the front-end readMe for an overview of the application.

To run this app: after cloning both repos, add your MongoDB details and jwtSecret token to a default.json in the config directory.<br>
After running `npm install` on both repositories to gather all the Node modules from your `package.json`, you can then run `npm start` for both repositories to access the app.<br>
The front-end React app will be able to access the routes and models coded here.<br>
This will allow you to have a working back-end to store your user data (including adding new songs, editing other songs, or deleting songs).
